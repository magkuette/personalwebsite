                Hello, my name is Margaret Hermanto.
                
                <br><br>
                
                I am Chinese Indonesian, born and raised in Maryland, USA.
                I am a junior majoring in Information Science at the University of Maryland, College Park.

                <br>
                <br>

                I created this website as a fun way to tell people a bit about myself, and also to practice
                my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Aside from these areas, I have experience with SQL, Python, and R!

                <br>
                <br>

                Additionally, I like to draw digitally (go check my work out at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/miantwo/" target="_blank">miantwo</a>
                on Instagram) but I love all things arts and crafts. I play the piano and I'm trying to learn the guitar bit by bit! I also love to
                learn about other cultures and find a lot of joy in speaking with international students and friends from around the world both on
                campus and online. So if you teach me a word in a language you speak, I'll definitely be overusing that everytime we talk.

                <br>
                <br>
