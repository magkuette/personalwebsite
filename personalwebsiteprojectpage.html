                                This program is aimed towards students at the University of Maryland (UMD) who have a university dining dollar plan,
                                which is used to pay for various products on campus.
                                <br>
                                The program uses a Tkinter GUI to take user input including
                                the user's name, dining dollar balance, and plan, as well as the current date and expiry date of the dining dollars.
                                Using the user input, the program outputs information concerning how often the user should use their dining dollars,
                                notifications regarding dining dollar use, and spending thresholds that the user has passed.

                                I developed this interface with Arnav Patel, a fellow student at the University of Maryland.
