        <h1>Background</h1>
        <div class="p-properties">
            <p>The Caeser Cipher is an algorithm that is used to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters.
                For example, if one would like to encrypt the letter "D", they could choose to shift it 2 to the right, which
                would mean the encrypted version of the letter "D" would be "F", as it is two letters down from "D". A key of 2
                to the left would mean the encrypted version of the letter "D" is "B".
            </p>
        </div>
        <h1>Project Concept</h1>
        <div class="p-properties">
            <p>The user can use the program console in order to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caeser Cipher.
                The program will first ask if the user would like to encrypt or decrypt a message. The program will then
                ask about the direction of the shift, the key (the amount of times the shift was/is going to be done), and
                then the outcome of the user's prompt. The program will finally ask the user if they would like to
                view what they encrypted or decrypted in a text file.
            </p>
