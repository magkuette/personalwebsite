        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>
            This program is intended to take user input from students at the University of Maryland
            in order to calculate information concerning their university dining dollars.
        </p>
        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>
            Dining Dollars are a type of currency used at the University of Maryland.
            They can be used for paying for various services on campus such as getting
            food at the Student Union, STAMP, buying from the convenience stores, and more.
            <br>
            As of now, the University of Maryland (UMD) has a website and app called UMD GET
            which is used to display students' remaining university dining dollar balance and
            recent purchases.
            <br>
            However, I and a friend from UMD - Arnav Patel - realized this app and website was missing a few features
            that we felt students needed.
        </p>
        <h1>Project Concept</h1>
        <p>
            Arnav and I designed a supplement to the UMD GET app which takes user data to do the following
            <ul>
                <li>Create a list in which a user should spend their Dining Dollars before they expire</li>
                <li>Calculate the amount of money the user has spent using quartile thresholds</li>
                <li>Create a basic daily spending plan</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
