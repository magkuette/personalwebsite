                This program is intended to take user input from students at the University of Maryland
                in order to calculate information concerning their university dining dollars.

                Dining Dollars are a type of currency used at the University of Maryland.
                They can be used for paying for various services on campus such as getting
                food at the Student Union, STAMP, buying from the convenience stores, and more.
                <br>
                Students are able to receive a Dining Dollar Plan by specifying the type of plan they would like.
                Such plans typically consist of an amount of either $200 or $400. The money in students' accounts
                expires.
                <br>
                As of now, the University of Maryland (UMD) has a website and app called UMD GET
                which is used to display students' remaining university dining dollar balance and
                recent purchases.
                <br>
                However, a friend from UMD - Arnav Patel - and I realized this app and website was missing a few features
                that we felt students needed.

                Arnav and I designed a supplement to the UMD GET app which takes user data to do any or all of the following

            <ul>

                <li>Calculate the amount of money the user has spent using quartile thresholds</li>
                <li>Create a basic daily spending plan</li>

                Arnav and I created the foundation of the program together and often met up to discuss and work on the project.
                We used GitHub to pass in each of our commits.
                <br>
                While working on the Dining Dollar Interface Add-On, Arnav was the driver of most of the back-end part
                including calculations of the Dining Dollars, while I was the driver of most of the front-end part
                including the placement of interactive user components on the screen using Tkinter, and error handling
                such as notifying the user when they have done something against the program's intention.

                This was my first time working on a Python project with such a large focus on object-oriented programming, which
                I did struggle with at times. There were many moments where Arnav and I would be staring at the code in complete silence,
                but a million thoughts going on in both of our heads at the same time no doubt. Fortunately, there were many moments when
                we'd say my favorite four-letter sentence: "I figured it out."
                <br>
                I had a lot of fun learning about Tkinter for the first time. It was my first time working on a GUI framework using Python
                and in the future I hope to learn more GUI frameworks.
