                This game of Blackjack involves a deck of 52 cards that is used among the user and the program (the dealer).
                <br><br>
                First, each the user and the Blackjack dealer will draw two cards from the deck of cards.
                The user's cards will be visible to them, and they will be able to know the total card value of the cards.
                The user will only be able to see one of the dealer's cards.
                <br><br>
                In the event that the user or the dealer gets a card that has an A, K, Q, or J: an A is always worth 11, and K, Q, and J are always worth 10 each.
                <br><br>
                This Blackjack game will calculate the user's total card value for them.
                The user will then determine whether they would like to "hit" or "stay".
                Hitting involves drawing another card from the deck. Staying involves doing nothing.
                Once the user chooses to stay, they are stuck with the amount of cards they have at that moment.
                <br><br>
                As for the dealer, they will keep taking new cards until their total card value is 17 or higher.
                Once their total card value is 17 or higher, they will stay.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, the user will only be able to see all of the dealer's cards once the dealer has a card value of 17 or higher.
                If the dealer has a card value of 16 or lower, the user will only be able to see one of the dealer's cards.
                <br><br>
                Going over a card value of 21 will result in a bust, meaning the player loses.
                If someone busts, then the other player wins.
                <br><br>
                In the event that both the dealer and the user are staying,
                the higher card value between them will win.
                <br><br>
                Another way to win is to get to a card value of 21 first, which is a Blackjack.

                This game is to be played in the program's console.
                <br><br>                
                After every win, the program will show the user their game states including the number of rounds they have played,
                the number of rounds they have won, the number of rounds they have lost, and the number of ties they have.
                The program will also ask the user if they would like to play again.
                If the user would like to play again and there are no more cards in the deck (since drawing a card means it is gone from the deck),
                then no problem! The deck will reshuffle and all the cards will be restored into the deck.
                If the user would not like to play again, the program will ask the user if they would like to view their game states in a file.
